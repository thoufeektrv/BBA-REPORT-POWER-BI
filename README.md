# BBA-REPORT-POWER-BI
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of baggage handling performance for various airlines across the selected date range. It focuses on key metrics like first and last bag delivery times, customs delays, and flight counts per airline.

ðŸ”¸ 1. Time of First Bag on Belt from ATA
            What It Shows: Minutes taken for the first bag to appear on the belt after the flightâ€™s Actual Time of Arrival (ATA).
            Flight Coverage: Includes multiple flights such as AI2454, AI2617, AI2655, AI2656, AI657, AI829, EK522, etc.
            Observation: Most flights deliver the first bag within 5â€“10 minutes. However, flights like AI2454 (20 mins) and EK522 (15 mins consistently) exceed the expected timeframe.
            Insight: Highlights which flights are experiencing delays in baggage offloading, aiding performance improvement.

ðŸ”¸ 2. Time of Last Bag from ATA
            What It Shows: Total time taken to deliver the last bag after ATA.
      Observation:
          EK522 consistently has the longest last bag times (ranging from 61 to 73 minutes).
          Other flights show more optimized timings, typically between 20â€“45 minutes.
            Insight: This metric reveals efficiency of ground staff and handlers in completing baggage delivery.

ðŸ”¸ 3. Customs Delay
            What It Shows: Delay (in minutes) due to customs intervention per flight.
      Observation:
        Most flights report low customs delays (under 5 mins).
        AI2655 shows a peak delay of 13 mins on 11-06-2025.
        AI657 also shows a higher delay (11 mins) on 13-06-2025.
            Insight: Helps identify where customs processes are causing operational delays.

ðŸ”¸ 4. Total Flights Handled by Each Airline
          IX: 62 flights
          AI: 35 flights
          EK, QR, TR: 7 flights each
          Q2, KU: 5â€“6 flights
          J9: 2 flights
      Insight: Shows flight volume distribution by airline, useful for resource allocation and performance benchmarking.

ðŸ”¸ 5. Key Metrics Panel (Right Sidebar)
          Total Flights Handled: 136
          Flights with First Bag Delay: 23
          Indicates approximately 17% of flights experienced a delay in first bag delivery.
          Operator Filter Panel: Enables filtering and analyzing specific airlines or flights as needed.
